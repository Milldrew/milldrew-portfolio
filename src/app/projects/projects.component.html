      moreContent="This app runs a containerized puppeteer service on the backend. The user can use a URL and a css selector to take screen shots. Puppeteer writes the files to a folder and the nestjs statically serves them. In retrospect I probably would have used playwright instead of puppeteer, and instead of statically serving the photos. I would resolve them in memory as buffers, and then render their URL in the browser using the Image Api. Playwright was created by the same people who started puppetter, except it appears to be a lot better, it supports multiple browsers, and has automatic wait."

This was one of the first projects I did when I switched from heavily using React to heavily using Angular. I did it for free university credit for a computer science course. After reviewing all of my options I decided I am better off getting a cloud computing degree. Right Now I am studying for Cloud Computing Certifications that can be subsituted for university credits."
