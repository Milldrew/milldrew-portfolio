This was one of the first projects I did when I switched from heavily using React to heavily using Angular. I did it for free university credit for a computer science course.

Right Now I am studying for Cloud Computing Certifications that can be subsituted for university credits."

      moreContent="The package exports the cli onsave. The first argument is the path to the file, and the second argument is the command that you want to run each time the file is saved. The CLI does work for hanging process like an http server. The handler command can be multiple arguments. It is also possible to write a bash script and then run the bash script each time the file is saved. This is one of the only old projects that survived from me deleting all my repos. I am happy it did! Because it comes in clutch when there is no --watch option."
