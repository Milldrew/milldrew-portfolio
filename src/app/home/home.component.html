      I am currently working for a start up company named Harvesta. Harvesta is
      an e-commerce app for connecting customers with their local farms.
      <br />
      <br />
      At Harvesta I am building the backend using AWS Serverless Application
      Model (SAM). SAM runs AWS Cloud Formation under the hood. I have setup the
      payment system. I also setup the authentication system . I did spearhead a
      github hosted npm package for mock data. I wrote a cli dev tool that
      watches the Infrastructure As Code (IAC) file and rebuilds the
      infrastructure locally every time we make a change to the IAC.
      <br />
      <br />

      I can get you in contact with my supervisor at Harvesta if you need want
      to speak with them as a reference.

      At the beginning of July 2020 I started studying Software Engineering at
      Launch School. The curriculum can take several years. I completed the core
      curriculum in around 4 months and got A's on my assessments.
      <br />
      <br />
      After completing the core curriculum I realized that the school was not
      going to help me get a job, by accepting me into the "capstone" program.
      For reasons out side of my academic performance. After 4 more months of
      studying NodeJS. I became certified by the OpenJS Foundation for
      developing NodeJs applications and network services, by completing the
      live NodeJS programming challenges. I completed the challenges in vim, and
      fell in love with vim. I love writing vimscript, bash script, and tmux
      script to automate my development environment.
      <br />
      <br />
      I did delete my first GitHub repo which contained hundreds possibly a
      thousand or more hours of coding.
      <br />
      <br />
      I have delete many of my small projects and a couple of github
      repositories. I have used a long list of technologies from react and
      graphql to kubernetes and terraform.
      <br />
      <br />
      I am a self guided solo software developer. I honestly love writing code.
      I have recently fallen in love with NestJS and Angular. I love them
      because they are nearly identical and there is little context change
      between UI development and API development.
      <br />
      <br />
      I am effective at every point in the technology stack. As a solo developer
      who can write code end to end, I have decided that I need to be able to
      create High Quality UI experiences rapidly. I have chosen Angular because
      of its relationship to NestJS, code generation, scalability.
